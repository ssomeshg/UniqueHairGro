                            A Beard transplant is similar to a hair transplant, where surgeons
                            take hair follicles from one part of your body, especially from the
                            back of your head and implant them in the affected area. FUE and
                            FUT are two commonly followed procedures where FUE is widely followed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are struggling with uneven stubble growth and unable to treat it
                            with natural oil and products available on the market, then it’s time
                            to think about a beard transplant. But please take care because it always
                            comes with a risk of scar, only a qualified and experienced surgeon can
                            help you with the best results.

                        <h3>Who is an ideal candidate?</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you always dreamed of having the perfect beard but failed to get it, you
                            can surely go for a beard transplant, demanding you have enough hair in the
                            donor area. The surgeon usually takes hair follicles from the back of your head.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It doesn’t matter if you lost hair from the front of your head. You still
                            might have some hairs on the back of your head. This makes most men eligible
                            for a beard transplant.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Benefits</h3>
                        <p>
                            Follicle Unit Extraction (FUE) is an advanced technique that’s popular nowadays.
                            We even recommend you go with the same because it has several advantages the FUT
                            cannot provide.

                                        <b>Least scarring</b><br>
                                        When each hair follicle is plucked directly from the source, it leaves
                                        almost zero possibility of scars. Even if it’s there, it will be invisible
                                        and hide beneath your hair. Also, you don’t have to worry about incisions
                                        or stitches in the donor area.

                                        Most of our patients continue their normal work life after a few days
                                        of transplantation. It looks pretty normal, and no one will be able to
                                        identify that you have undergone a beard transplant surgery.

                                        The process is painless because before transplanting, surgeons will numb
                                        the donor and affected area using local anaesthesia. After surgery, painkillers
                                        will ensure that you feel no pain.

                                        of over 90%. There are extremely high chances of you getting the beard you

                        Beard transplants sound easy, but in reality, they are much
                        more complicated because a surgeon has to work on your facial

                        Getting it done by a qualified and experienced surgeon is always recommended.
