                            We all have beautiful and bouncy skin during teenage or early
                            adulthood, but it tends to get dry, wrinkly and dull as we age.
                            It’s a natural process that will happen someday; it happens
                            earlier for those who don’t care for their skin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chemical peeling helps eliminate this problem (up to an extent).
                            During treatment, doctors use chemicals to remove the upper
                            layer of your skin, revealing the softer, healthier, shiny
                            skin underneath. The process can be light, medium, and deep.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although there are hardly any side effects, you might get rashes,
                            uneven skin, irritation, swelling, dark skin tone, etc., because
                            of a poorly done job.
