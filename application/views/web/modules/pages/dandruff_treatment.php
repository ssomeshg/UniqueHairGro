            <h3>What exactly is dandruff?</h3>
            <p>
              Dandruff is a standard skin condition on your scalp, causing
              itchiness and dry skin flakes. It mostly happens in the cold
              season when your skin dries and shreds. It’s usual, and almost
              everyone has faced the problem of dandruff in their life.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, some people have more sensitive skin that reacts to
              dandruff, intensifying the problem. There are various home
              remedies and products that anyone can use; if nothing happens
              and the condition worsens, it is good to connect with a
              dermatologist, or else your hair will start coming out with
              time.
            </p>
            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <p>
              Everyone dreams of having dandruff-free hair where they can
              wear the dark colour clothes of their choice without any fear
              of getting pointed out for dandruff falling from their head.
              Many other benefits include.

                    <b>Reduces hair fall</b><br>
                    Your hairs lose their strength because of dry skin and
                    become more prone to damage. They result in excess hair
                    fall. Usually, it doesn’t happen in everyday situations,
                    but losing hair is a common symptom if you have a medical
                    condition.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Reduces the itchiness</b><br>
                    Dandruff happens because of dry skin that irritates. Because
                    of it, you scratch your scalp all day, resulting in a red scalp
                    and intensifying the pre-existing problem. A dandruff treatment
                    will not only help you to reduce the skin flakes but also provide
                    you with relief from itchiness.

                    hairs with solid roots that don’t come out quickly. It improves

            <p>

              the prescribed medication is mild that doesn’t show any harmful
              effect on other organs. So, it’s safe, but in a rare conditions,
