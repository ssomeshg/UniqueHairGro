            <p>
              Post covid, hair loss has become a common problem among many
              men and women. But the available treatment processes are
              pretty expensive and require heavy use of medication or
              transplants.
            </p>
            <p>
              Indeed, an alternate solution was required that provides
              near to same results but solves these existing problems.
              Surprisingly, Wockhardt’s scientists (a global pharmaceutical
              and biotechnology company headquartered in Mumbai, India)
              came up with a solution named Growth Factor concentrate (GFC).
            </p>

            <p>
              The process includes taking your own blood, extracting growth
              factors, and re-injecting it into your scalp to promote hair
              growth. A similar treatment is also used for skin, but we will
              stick to GFC hair treatment in Chennai for this article.
            </p>

            <p>
              The unique hair gro hair transplant clinic already specialises
              in providing effective GFC for hair loss treatment. You can
              always connect us for immediate help. Please read through for
              more details about the topic.
            </p>

            <h3>Who is eligible for a GFC treatment?</h3>
            <p>
              The treatment is best suited for individuals above 18 years
              who are facing patterned hair loss. It is suitable for both
              men and women. Depending upon the severity of the conditions,
              the number of sessions may vary, but the line of treatment
              is the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, a GFC treatment doesn’t include the complications of
              extracting hair follicles; you don’t need thick hairs in the
              donor area. That makes almost everyone eligible for the treatment.
              However, you must not have any chronic or blood-related disease.
            </p>
            <h3>Benefits of GFC hair treatment</h3>
            <p>
              GFC is a new achievement in the field of hair treatment. Indeed,
              it delivers certain benefits
            </p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Increase the density of your hair, reduce hair fall,
                    and make hair thicker.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Best suitable for those in the early stages of
                    Alopecia(a condition where the immune system attacks hair
                    follicles to cause hair loss).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The procedure is suitable for both men and women.
                    Show guaranteed results.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="col-md-6">
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Simple process that doesn’t include complications of
                    surgery or transplanting.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Most side effects usually disappear within a week of treatment.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Possible side-effects</h3>
            <p>
              GFC hair treatment is more like a natural process where doctors
              take your own blood to extract growth factors and re-inject your
              scalp. They don’t mix anything, which is why it’s among the safest
              procedures where the chance of complications is rare.
            </p>
            <p>
              It doesn’t mean the process is all milk and honey. It includes
              certain side-effects like
            </p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Post-session headache, nausea and vomiting.
                    That’s why doctors recommend a resting period of 20 to 25 minutes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In rare cases, patients can face problems like diarrhoea, stomach pain and dizziness.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>
              Also, the treatment doesn’t include the necessary consumption of
              medicines and again marginalises the side effects.
