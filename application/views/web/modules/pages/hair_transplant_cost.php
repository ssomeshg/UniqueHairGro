                                        It’s the costliest treatment 
                                        because it is also the most effective one. 
                                        Surgeons use a hand-held device to pluck each hair 
                                        follicle; then, they make incisions in your scalp to implant 
                                        each hair follicle. It requires multiple sittings 
                                        that increase the overall cost.

                                        On average, an FUE treatment would cost you ₹60,000.
                                         Depending on the factors explained above, it can go 
                                         as high as ₹1,50,000 or as low as ₹25,000.

                                        FUT is another type of surgical transplant that costs 
                                        less, but it’s an old technique, and its use has declined 
                                        because of the FUE hair transplant. In this technique, 
                                        surgeons cut a small patch of scalp from the back of your 
                                        head, cut it into small parts, and transplant theminto 
                                        the affected area. It’s best if you have fewer hairs in 
                                        the donor area.

                                        A FUT treatment will cost you around ₹50,000. 
                                        The cost may increase or decrease based on multiple factors.

                                        It’s a three-step non-surgical technique where doctors draw 
                                        blood from one part of your body, process it, and inject it 
                                        into your scalp. The plasma-rich blood promotes the strength 
                                        and growth of your hair.

                                        A PRP treatment would cost around ₹3,000 to ₹5,000 in 
                                        India. But it requires a maintenance injection every six months, 
                                        which increases the cost.

                            If we look at the starting cost of all three treatments, it easily 
                            fits most of your budget. However, you must take care of two things 
                            before finalizing a surgery.
