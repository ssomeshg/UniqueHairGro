                Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy is a non-surgical treatment 
                where small amount of blood from one part of the body is collected, 
                and spin it in a centrifuge machine, which separates the growth 
                factors from plasma. The acquired plasma is then injected into   
                your scalp to protect the hair follicles and promote hair growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Medical science lacks research that justifies the benefits the 
                treatment brings. A few types of research were done with a group 
                of around 40 people and had a success rate of over 90%, but data 
                is limited and cannot assure a guaranteed result.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Even processing and transfusing blood has a severe risk of infections 
                that, if not conducted under experienced doctors, can bring much more 
                harm than good. <b>Unique Hair Gro Hair Transplant Clinic is one clinic</b>

              <h3>Who is an ideal candidate?</h3>
              <p>
                PRP therapy comes with only a few restrictions, and most may not find themselves 
                eligible for this therapy. It includes blood work that eliminates blood donors 
                with severe diseases, including cancer, liver disease, thyroid, low platelet counts,
                 etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Patients facing acute or chronic infections are also ineligible for the process. 
                We consider various factors before injecting you with your blood, most of which 
                can only be known after thoroughly checking your medical history and current 
                health conditions. It’s recommended to connect with a doctor for an exact answer.

              <h3>Benefits of PRP hair treatment</h3>
              <p>
                PRP is much different from regular transplants but provides many similar benefits 
                at lesser costs in a shorter time. Here are some benefits our patients experienced 
                after going through the <b> best PRP hair treatment in Chennai</b>.
              </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Better strength, repair, and healing</b><br>
                    New blood helps your follicles regain the lost strength, resulting in solid hairs 
                    that restrict hair fall. Also, the results are immediate and slightly faster.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Stimulate new hair growth</b><br>
                    You might have many follicles in your scalp that stopped producing new hairs because 
                    they are undernourished. The treatment will provide those follicles with the necessary 
                    vitamins to promote new hair growth. Don’t expect a complete makeover with thick hairs, 
                    but then you can expect hairs to be 15% to 20% better than before.

            PRP treatments are much more accessible than traditional hair transplants, 
            but the results aren’t awe-inspiring. If you have some hairs in the affected 
            area but continuously lose them because of hair fall, it’s an excellent way to save. 
            You cannot get transplant-like results in PRP.
